This project is the part of my DS/ML portfolio. I chose *Titanic* dataset because of it simplicity, I had minor experience with python and that was my first end-to-end project. Firstly I thought I would only end with analysis done in python, but later I decided to add an R notebook as well.

## Python

I used **scikit-learn**, **pandas** and **NumPy** packages. 

## R

I used libraries from the **tideverse** universe. The notebook is still under development. 

## Kaggle score

Python solution got 0.77511 accurancy on Kaggle. Nonetheless, the final score wasn't the main goal of this project.

## Release History

* 0.1 - Jupyter notebook with analysis in python
